# unsupervised-domain-clusters
This repository contains code and data accompanying our ACL 2020 paper, ["Unsupervised Domain Clusters in Pretrained Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02105.pdf). 

## data
The multi-domain German-English parallel data we used in the paper is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yvB-pvlojtT2UpOX1JvwtD6rw9joQ49A) (626MB). It is a new data split we created that avoids duplicate examples and leakage from the train split to the dev/test splits. The original multi-domain data first appeared in [Koehn and Knowles (2017)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-3204/) and consists of five datasets available in the [Opus website](http://opus.nlpl.eu/).
